# Emotionally-Intelligent-AI-A-New-Frontier-for-Conflict-Resolution-in-Virtual-Workspaces

**Abstract**

The rapid expansion of virtual workspaces has amplified the complexity of managing interpersonal conflicts due to the absence of critical non-verbal emotional cues present in face-to-face communication. This research introduces an advanced, emotionally intelligent AI mediator designed explicitly for resolving conflicts within virtual teams. Our proposed solution employs multimodal deep-learning architecturesâ€”including DistilBERT for text sentiment analysis, DeepFace for facial emotion recognition, and Wav2Vec2 combined with Pyannote audio diarization for accurate voice emotion assessment. The system dynamically analyzes interactions in real-time, integrating context-sensitive Natural Language Generation (via T5) to deliver personalized and empathetic mediation prompts. Ethical considerations, privacy safeguards (such as facial blurring, explicit consent mechanisms, and controlled data retention), and adaptive conflict-threshold tuning enhance both trust and user acceptance. A user-centric dashboard built with Streamlit provides transparency and manual override capabilities. This novel, comprehensive approach represents a significant advancement in affective computing, offering organizations an effective tool to improve virtual collaboration, emotional health, and productivity.
